# RAG Q&A Assistant

A "chat with your documents" web app. Ask it a question, and it answers **using only the documents you gave it** — with source citations, and an honest "I don't know" when the answer isn't in there.

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system: the model doesn't answer from memory, it retrieves relevant text from an indexed knowledge base and grounds its answer in that text, which prevents made-up answers ("hallucinations") and makes every answer traceable to a source file.

**Live demo:** https://rag-app-assistant-my4m2hkty2ovktagqywdsx.streamlit.app

## Results

The evaluation suite (`eval.py`) scores **8/8** on its test set, which includes negative cases — questions the assistant should refuse to answer because the answer isn't in the documents. It's graded with an LLM-as-judge: Gemini checks whether each generated answer matches the expected one, including honestly saying "I don't know" when it should.

## How it works

```
question ──▶ embed ──▶ search ChromaDB ──▶ top 4 relevant chunks
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                              prompt = chunks + question + instructions
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                          Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash)
                                                    │
                                                    ▼
                                   answer + list of source filenames
```

1. **Ingestion** (`ingest.py`) — reads every file in `docs/`, splits each into ~800-character overlapping chunks, embeds them with ChromaDB's built-in local embedding model, and stores them in a persistent vector database (`./chroma`).
2. **Retrieval** (`rag.py`) — embeds the incoming question the same way, then searches Chroma for the 4 chunks whose meaning is closest to it (semantic search, not keyword matching).
3. **Grounded generation** (`rag.py`) — builds a prompt containing only those chunks plus the question, and instructs Gemini to answer strictly from that context and cite its sources.
4. **Evaluation** (`eval.py`) — runs a fixed set of test questions through the same pipeline and uses Gemini as an automatic judge to score answer quality, so correctness is measured, not assumed.

The web app also fails gracefully: if a Gemini API call errors out (e.g. the free-tier quota is exhausted), `app.py` catches it, logs the real error server-side, and shows the user a plain-English message instead of a raw traceback.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.11+ |
| LLM | Google Gemini (`gemini-2.5-flash`) via the `google-genai` SDK |
| Embeddings | ChromaDB's built-in local embedding function |
| Vector database | ChromaDB (persistent, local) |
| Document reading | `pypdf` for PDFs, plain text for `.txt` / `.md` |
| UI | Streamlit |
| Deployment | Streamlit Community Cloud |

No LangChain or other RAG framework — the retrieval and prompting logic is written directly so every step is visible and easy to reason about.

## Project structure

```

├── docs/                # source documents the assistant answers from
├── ingest.py             # loads docs → chunks → stores in Chroma
├── rag.py                # retrieves relevant chunks + asks the LLM
├── llm.py                # thin wrapper around the Gemini API call (with retry/backoff)

```

## Running it locally

1. Clone the repo and create a virtual environment:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/17akshatt/RAG-QA-Assistant.git
   cd RAG-QA-Assistant
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Get a free Gemini API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), then create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
3. Add your own `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files to `docs/` (a few sample docs are included).
4. Build the index:
   ```
   python ingest.py
   ```
5. Ask a question from the command line:
   ```
   python ask.py "your question here"
   ```
   or launch the web app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
6. (Optional) Check answer quality:
   ```
   python eval.py
   ```

## Deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push this repo to GitHub (see below).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io), sign in, and deploy a new app pointing at this repo's `app.py`.
3. In the app's **Settings → Secrets**, add:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
   ```
   **Never commit your API key to GitHub** — it's kept out of the repo via `.gitignore` and only lives in Streamlit's Secrets settings for the deployed app.

## What I'd improve next

- Re-rank retrieved chunks before sending them to the model, instead of relying on raw similarity order.
- Stream the model's response instead of waiting for the full answer.
- Handle larger document sets with metadata filtering (e.g. search within one file).
